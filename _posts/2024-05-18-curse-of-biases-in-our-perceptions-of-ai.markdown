Large Language Models/transformers are phenomenal, and excitement around these technologies is appropriate, but good grief, how much of the discussion jumps the shark? 

Why so credulous when it comes to AI? We seem especially willing to believe all sorts of outrageous claims. 

I believe we're led astray by our cognitive biases, the shortcuts we use to understand the world. The most relevant of these for our enthusiasm for AI is our love of anthropomorphization.

We see faces in [inanimate objects](https://lnkd.in/gjEe_USG),  [Eliza](https://lnkd.in/gpBy_EPA) was heralded by many as an amazing psychotherapist, early Roombas were given [names](https://lnkd.in/g3Nv5BMU), and even how the ancients saw [emotions](https://lnkd.in/g8mxSdNu) in natural phenomena. We all massively over-generalize from small slices of behavior or shapes that we associate with living things.

So what chance do we have at taking a cold-eyed, rational view of the realities of something that works with language as well as todays AI/large language models, let alone when there's human-shaped robots out there.

It's no wonder that so much of the discussion around these technologies trends to the breathless and fantastical.

We need clarity of language around the realities of today's AI. The pragmatics, if you like. What does it actually do? Where strong and where weak? Where does it bring economic and social wins, where is it fragile, where should it be regulated, where not? What are the grounded, near term risks to our informational world?

The notion of pragmatics, of understanding the realities of emerging tech, what's stable, and what's likely to churn is core to what we do at Robotics Hub, and should be at the forefront for anyone looking to invest in advanced technologies/deep tech, especially in fast evolving fields like AI and Robotics.

More generally, in situations with a degree of hype driving a market, it's critical to understand the incentives behind various claims. What's driving various commentators, what drives different positions in marketing, who wins, and who loses?
